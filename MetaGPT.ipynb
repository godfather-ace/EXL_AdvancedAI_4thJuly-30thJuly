The code is mostly implemented as per the requirements. However, it could be improved for better modularity and readability. For instance, separating the Pygame initialization from the UI class constructor would make the code more modular.\n","2. The code logic is correct but lacks efficiency in handling screen updates. For example, the screen is cleared and updated every time the score is updated, which is not efficient. A better approach would be to update only the part of the screen that displays the score.\n","3. The existing code does not fully follow the \"Data structures and interfaces\" as it directly handles game restart and quit actions within the UI class. These actions should be managed by the Game class to adhere to the separation of concerns principle.\n","4. All functions are implemented, but the `_wait_for_player_action` method could be improved. Currently, it handles both quitting the game and restarting it, which could be separated for clarity and reusability.\n","5. All necessary pre-dependencies have been imported. However, the code could benefit from importing specific Pygame modules instead of the entire Pygame library for efficiency.\n","6. Methods from other files are not being reused in the provided code snippet, but the UI class is designed to be used by the Game class, which is correct as per the system design.\n","\n","## Actions\n","1. Refactor the Pygame initialization to be outside of the UI class. This could be done in the main game loop or a separate initializer function.\n","   ```python\n","   def initialize_pygame():\n","       pygame.init()\n","       screen = pygame.display.set_mode((600, 400))\n","       pygame.display.set_caption('Snake Game')\n","       return screen\n","   ```\n","2. Modify the `update_score` method to only update the score area of the screen.\n","   ```python\n","   def update_score(self, score: int) -> None:\n","       score_text = self.font.render(f'Score: {score}', True, (255, 255, 255))\n","       self.screen.blit(score_text, (10, 10))\n","       pygame.display.update()\n","   ```\n","3. Move the game restart and quit logic to the Game class. The UI class should only notify the Game class of player actions.\n","   ```python\n","   def _wait_for_player_action(self) -> None:\n","       while True:\n","           for event in pygame.event.get():\n","               if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n","                   return 'QUIT'\n","               elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:\n","                   if event.key == pygame.K_r:\n","                       return 'RESTART'\n","   ```\n","4.
